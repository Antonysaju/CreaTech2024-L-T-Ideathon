Our idea involves a system with three integrated subsystems aimed at boosting operational efficiency: Firstly, the Equipment & Asset Utilization Monitoring subsystem uses a token-based checkout process to track and manage assets digitally, analyzing data with ARIMA to optimize inventory usage. Next, the Productivity Analysis subsystem evaluates workforce productivity by comparing time and force metrics, helping to identify trends and make necessary adjustments for improved efficiency. Finally, the Infrastructure & Equipment Maintenance subsystem categorizes infrastructure for systematic maintenance, detects defects through vibration monitoring, and uses service data to estimate product lifetimes, ensuring effective resource management.
